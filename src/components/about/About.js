      I’m so thrilled that you found me! I am a photographer in the Washington D.C./Northern Virginia area. I am based in Manassas, VA and specialize in wedding photography and on-location lifestyle photography; which means I like to capture moments: moments that are natural and relaxed. These are the real moments that you will want to remember. One day these moments will just be a memory, but the images I capture will live on as a reminder of these special times.
